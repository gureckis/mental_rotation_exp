      Thank you for participating in this study! The task you just completed is called a
      <strong>mental rotation task</strong>, originally developed by psychologists Roger Shepard and Jacqueline Metzler
      in 1971.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this task, you viewed pairs of 3D block figures and judged whether they were the same object (just rotated) or
      different objects (mirror images). To make this judgment, most people report that they
      <strong>mentally rotate</strong> one of the objects in their mind's eye to see if it matches the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the key findings from this research is that the time it takes to make a judgment increases linearly with
      the angle of rotation between the two objects. In other words, the more you have to mentally rotate an object, the
      longer it takes &mdash; just as if you were physically rotating a real object in your hands!
